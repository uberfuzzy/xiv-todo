# XIV Todo

> A kanban styled self-resetting daily/weekly tracker for FFXIV.

Various tasks in FFXIV reset their reward availability on a known cadence. Most usually "daily" (except for all the things that arent)

This project will be a clientside localstorage'd tracker for these events.

It will store when you completed it, use that to calculate when it will reset, and when that point is past, auto "un-complete" that tile. This is extra helpful for irregular and weekly items.
